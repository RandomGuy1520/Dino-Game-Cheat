# DinoGame
This Python code plays the dino game (chrome://dino) for you. Sorta cheating, huh?

For this program to work, you need:
1. A computer of 1920x1080
2. Google Chrome

Some reminders:
1. Please ensure your Dino Game website is chrome://dino, or else it won't work.
2. Many people have different kinds of settings, so I cannot be 100% sure this code works. When I tested it on one of my friend's computer, it didn't work. So I am sorry if this code does not work for your setting.

How to use this code:
Run the program and it will give you 3 seconds to open the Dino Game window and start the game (you must start it yourself).
Then it will start automatically jumping when it detects obstacles.
If the game ends, it will automatically screenshot the whole screen and save it to D:\ (the D drive), and stop playing.
If you want the program to end, you can hold the 's' key and the program will end.

Some Info:
This program averages about 10000 points (on my computer). Sometimes you will get lucky and get over 20000 points.
If you don't achieve the average score of 10000, then you can change the detecting values of the cacti in the code so that the values are best for your setting.
